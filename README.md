# Assignment4
This project addresses Assignment No. 4, which focuses on practicing the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning for image classification.
The goal is to classify flower images into their correct categories using at least two pre-trained CNN models, while reporting probabilistic outputs for each class.
Choose at least two pre-trained models (YOLOv5 and VGG19) and adapt them to the current task. Note: You must use the YOLOV5 and VGG19. You may use additional pretrained models.
